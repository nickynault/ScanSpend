✅ VSCode Setup Instructions for ScanSpend
Open VSCode to the ScanSpend/ folder

Ensure correct Git branch and pull latest

git status      # see what branch you're on
git checkout main or BigBoss
git pull origin main or BigBoss

Activate the virtual environment
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install any missing dependencies (only if needed)
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the FastAPI backend locally

uvicorn main:app --reload
# or if your app is inside /app folder
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Open browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8000
(Optional) Run with auto-reload if editing backend code

✅ Bonus Tips
If uvicorn is not recognized, re-activate the venv and make sure it was installed.

Make sure your interpreter in VSCode is set to:
venv\Scripts\python.exe

Don’t commit the venv/ folder or .env files — they’re ignored via .gitignore.
